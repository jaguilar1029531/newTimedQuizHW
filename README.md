# newTimedQuizHW
I messed up and deleted my last repository because it got too entangled with mistakes, but I have a screenshot that shows I made 13 commits before creating this one

i've never had to do so much google-fu in my life, and yes this is not complete but i wanted to turn in something. I still need a minus 5 second timer for wrong answers and a high score card, neither of those seem too difficult and i will get on them asap

in this homework assignment i was to create a multiple choice quiz with a timer

I created my own questions mostly and appended them to the html doc

with some buttons that activated when i pressed them to let me move around the quiz and submit answers
